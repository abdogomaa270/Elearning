/app/project there is folders , each one refere to an entity in this project with it's service and controller  except Auth functionality ,,
I have been involved in the development of an e-learning system that aims to provide users with access to a wide range of courses and resources. In this system, the admin is responsible for storing and managing resources such as categories, subcategories, and courses. Users can view and purchase courses, take quizzes, and receive certificates from their instructors upon completion.

One of the unique features of this e-learning system is the ability for users to purchase courses using their balance. Users can request to charge their balance by sending a request to the admin, and the admin approves the request. This allows users to easily manage their finances and make purchases without the need for external payment systems.
